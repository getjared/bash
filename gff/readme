a gollum-themed bash script for system-wide file searching with colorful output. (it's pretty pointless but i use it ;p)

features
• case-insensitive file search across the entire system
• gollum-inspired dialogue during the search process
• colorful terminal output for enhanced readability
• simple and user-friendly interface

§ prerequisites
• bash shell
• sudo privileges (for system-wide search)

§ installation
git clone https://github.com/getjared/bash.git
cd bash/gff
chmod +x gff

§ usage
run the script with sudo:
if no filename is provided, you will be prompted to enter one.

sudo ./gff.sh [filename]

works best if you throw an alias into your bashrc file
alias g='sudo <path/to/file/>gff.sh [filename]'

§ examples
search for a file named "myfile.txt":
sudo ./gff.sh myfile.txt


search for a file with mixed case:
sudo ./gff.sh MyFiLe.TxT

§ note
this script requires sudo privileges to search the entire file system. always be cautious when running scripts with elevated permissions.
easter egg if you have any files named ring, precious, hobbit or fish somewhere on your system :3
