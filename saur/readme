sauron is a super minimal irc client written in bash without external dependencies. it's named after the all-seeing eye from the lord of the rings.

features
• connects to irc servers and channels
• sends and receives messages
• supports basic irc commands (/join, /msg, /quit)
• colorful terminal output for enhanced readability
• no external dependencies - runs with just bash
• customizable server, port, nickname, username, and channel


§ requirements

• bash shell (version 4.0 or higher recommended)
• a working internet connection


§ installation

git clone https://github.com/getjared/bash.git
cd bash/sauron
chmod +x sauron.sh


§ usage

run the script with optional parameters:

./sauron.sh [-s server] [-p port] [-n nickname] [-u username] [-r realname] [-c channel]

if no parameters are provided, default values will be used.
best way to actually use it is to add an alias to your .bashrc


§ command-line options

• `-s`: irc server (default: irc.libera.chat)
• `-p`: irc port (default: 6667)
• `-n`: nickname (default: sauronBot)
• `-u`: username (default: sauron)
• `-r`: real name (default: Bash IRC Client)
• `-c`: channel to join (default: #bash)

§ in-client commands

• `/quit`: exit the client
• `/join #channel`: join a new channel
• `/msg user message`: send a private message to a user


§ example

connect to a specific server and channel:
make sure you add the "" around the channel name.

./sauron.sh -s irc.example.com -c yourname "#mychannel"

bash sauron.sh -s irc.libera.chat -p 6667 -n getjared -c "#bash"


§ note

this is a minimal irc client intended for basic usage and learning purposes. it may not support all irc features or have robust error handling. use at your own discretion, and remember the only real security you need to worry about is the patch for human stupidity.
